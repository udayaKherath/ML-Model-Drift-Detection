# ML Model Drift Detection Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting drifts in machine learning (ML) models when the data changes over time. The aim is to identify both data drift and concept drift by employing 
various techniques such as KL divergence, chi-square test, Population stability index (PSI) etc. Different ML models are trained on different datasets to analyze their performance in detecting drift.

## Project Process

### 1. Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can automatically detect drifts in ML models caused by changes in data distribution or underlying concepts. 
By detecting drifts early, we can take proactive measures to maintain model performance and reliability in real-world applications.

### 2. Data Collection
We collected historical data from various sources, including online repositories, APIs, and internal databases. The datasets cover a wide range of domains and scenarios to 
ensure comprehensive coverage of potential drift patterns.

### 3. Preprocessing
The collected data underwent preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization. We also conducted exploratory data analysis to gain 
insights into the data distribution and identify any anomalies.

### 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection were applied to extract relevant information from the data and improve 
model performance.

### 5. Model Training
We trained multiple ML models, including decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and gradient boosting, on the preprocessed datasets. Each model was trained 
using cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and evaluate performance.

### 6. Drift Detection Techniques
Drift detection techniques such as KL divergence, chi-square test, and Wasserstein distance were implemented to monitor changes in the data distribution and model performance over time. 
We developed custom algorithms to detect both data drift (changes in input data) and concept drift (changes in target concept).

### 7. Evaluation
The performance of each model in detecting drifts was evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). We compared the 
effectiveness of different models and techniques in identifying data and concept drift under different scenarios.

## Results
Our experiments demonstrate that the developed drift detection system is effective in detecting both data and concept drifts in ML models. The system achieved high accuracy and 
robustness across different datasets and drift scenarios. However, challenges such as handling imbalanced data and adapting to dynamic environments remain areas for further research.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, detecting drifts in ML models is essential for maintaining model performance and reliability in real-world applications. By employing drift detection techniques and 
continuously monitoring model performance, we can ensure that ML models remain accurate and up-to-date over time. This project lays the foundation for future research in drift 
detection and model maintenance.
